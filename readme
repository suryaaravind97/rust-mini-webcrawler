 lightweight Rust-based web crawler that:

- Crawls websites using BFS traversal  
- Manages a scalable URL frontier with deduplication  
- Filters same-domain links  
- Extracts structured product data (name, price, link) from Walmart search pages  
- Saves results into `products.csv`  
- Demonstrates core system-design concepts used in production-grade crawling systems
